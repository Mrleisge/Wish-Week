	<p>Meet Carter! Carter is 5 years old and has been battling the struggles of Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome, a single ventricle heart defect with pulmonary atresia and tricuspid valve atresia. Carter has already had 3 open heart surgeries and will likely need a heart transplant down the road. Carter is one of the most loving, smiley, and happy little girls. She's always down to draw, paint, and she loves to be creative. Carter's heart is so kind and her smile is so bright. Carter and her little brother, Luca, love to dance to her favorite song called, "Rocking Like a Hurricane" from the movie Trolls! She loves rainbows, doing science experiments with her grandma, and being with her family. While recovering, she would conduct science experiments with her grandma and neighbor. Her love for science inspired her wish. Carter's wish is to travel to Hawaii and meet a volcano scientist!! We need your help to spread the magic of Wish Week to our community and to grant as many wishes as possible for children like Carter!</p>
